/**
 * A function is the basic unit of code that can be invoked in ActionScript. Both user-defined and built-in functions in ActionScript are represented by Function objects, which are instances of the Function class.
 * <p>Methods of a class are slightly different than Function objects. Unlike an ordinary function object, a method is tightly linked to its associated class object. Therefore, a method or property has a definition that is shared among all instances of the same class. Methods can be extracted from an instance and treated as "bound" methods (retaining the link to the original instance). For a bound method, the <code>this</code> keyword points to the original object that implemented the method. For a function, <code>this</code> points to the associated object at the time the function is invoked.</p>

  /**
   * Invokes the function represented by a Function object. Every function in ActionScript is represented by a Function object, so all functions support this method.
   * <p>In almost all cases, the function call (<code>()</code>) operator can be used instead of this method. The function call operator produces code that is concise and readable. This method is primarily useful when the <code>thisObject</code> parameter of the function invocation needs to be explicitly controlled. Normally, if a function is invoked as a method of an object within the body of the function, <code>thisObject</code> is set to <code>myObject</code>, as shown in the following example:</p>
   * <listing>
   *   myObject.myMethod(1, 2, 3);
   *  </listing>
   * <p>In some situations, you might want <code>thisObject</code> to point somewhere else; for example, if a function must be invoked as a method of an object, but is not actually stored as a method of that object:</p>
   * <listing>
   *   myObject.myMethod.call(myOtherObject, 1, 2, 3);
   *  </listing>
   * <p>You can pass the value <code>null</code> for the <code>thisObject</code> parameter to invoke a function as a regular function and not as a method of an object. For example, the following function invocations are equivalent:</p>
   * <listing>
   *   Math.sin(Math.PI / 4)
   *   Math.sin.call(null, Math.PI / 4)
   *  </listing>
   * <p>Returns the value that the called function specifies as the return value.</p>
   * @param thisArg An object that specifies the value of <code>thisObject</code> within the function body.
   * @param args The parameter or parameters to be passed to the function. You can specify zero or more parameters.
   *
   * @return <code><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/specialTypes.html#*">*</a></code>
