 * Jangaroo's base URL to use for loading resources like scripts and classes.
 * Must be set before loading jangaroo-application.js.
 * This URL is usually not used directly, but rather <code>resolveUrl()</code> is used to
 * resolve a relative URL against the base URL.
 * <p>If not set, it is determined by finding the first script element with a jangaroo-* src URL
 * and using its base URL minus the "joo" path.</p>
 * <p>If this fails, the base URL defaults to the empty string, so the "joo" path is relative to
 * the current request URL.</p>
