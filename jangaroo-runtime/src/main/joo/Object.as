/**
 * The Object class is at the root of the ActionScript class hierarchy. Objects are created by constructors using the <code>new</code> operator syntax, and can have properties assigned to them dynamically. Objects can also be created by assigning an object literal, as in:
 * <listing>
 * var obj:Object = {a:"foo", b:"bar"}</listing>
 * <p>All classes that don't declare an explicit base class extend the built-in Object class.</p>
 * <p>You can use the Object class to create <i>associative arrays</i>. At its core, an associative array is an instance of the Object class, and each key-value pair is represented by a property and its value. Another reason to declare an associative array using the Object data type is that you can then use an object literal to populate your associative array (but only at the time you declare it). The following example creates an associative array using an object literal, accesses items using both the dot operator and the array access operator, and then adds a new key-value pair by creating a new property:</p>
 * <listing>
 *  var myAssocArray:Object = {fname:"John", lname:"Public"};
 *  trace(myAssocArray.fname);     // John
 *  trace(myAssocArray["lname"]);  // Public
 *  myAssocArray.initial = "Q";
 *  trace(myAssocArray.initial);   // Q</listing>
 * <p>ActionScript 3.0 has two types of inheritance: class inheritance and prototype inheritance:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Class inheritance - is the primary inheritance mechanism and supports inheritance of fixed properties. A fixed property is a variable, constant or method declared as part of a class definition. Every class definition is now represented by a special class object that stores information about the class.</li>
 * <li>Prototype inheritance - is the only inheritance mechanism in previous versions of ActionScript and serves as an alternate form of inheritance in ActionScript 3.0. Each class has an associated prototype object, and the properties of the prototype object are shared by all instances of the class. When a class instance is created, it has a reference to its class's prototype object, which serves as a link between the instance and its associated class prototype object. At run time, when a property is not found on a class instance, the delegate, which is the class prototype object, is checked for that property. If the prototype object does not contain the property, the process continues with the prototype object's delegate checking in consecutively higher levels in the hierarchy until the Flash runtime finds the property.</li></ul>
 * <p>Both class inheritance and prototype inheritance can exist simultaneously, as shown in the following example:</p>
 * <listing>
 *  class A {
 *      var x = 1
 *      prototype.px = 2
 *  }
 *  dynamic class B extends A {
 *      var y = 3
 *      prototype.py = 4
 *  }
 *
 *  var b = new B()
 *  b.x // 1 via class inheritance
 *  b.px // 2 via prototype inheritance from A.prototype
 *  b.y // 3
 *  b.py // 4 via prototype inheritance from B.prototype
 *
 *  B.prototype.px = 5
 *  b.px // now 5 because B.prototype hides A.prototype
 *
 *  b.px = 6
 *  b.px // now 6 because b hides B.prototype</listing>
 * <p>Using functions instead of classes, you can construct custom prototype inheritance trees. With classes, the prototype inheritance tree mirrors the class inheritance tree. However, since the prototype objects are dynamic, you can add and delete prototype-based properties at run time.</p>

public dynamic class Object {
  /**
   * A reference to the class object or constructor function for a given object instance. If an object is an instance of a class, the <code>constructor</code> property holds a reference to the class object. If an object is created with a constructor function, the <code>constructor</code> property holds a reference to the constructor function. Do not confuse a constructor function with a constructor method of a class. A constructor function is a Function object used to create objects, and is an alternative to using the <code>class</code> keyword for defining classes.
   * <p>If you use the <code>class</code> keyword to define a class, the class's prototype object is assigned a property named <code>constructor</code> that holds a reference to the class object. An instance of the class inherits this property from the prototype object. For example, the following code creates a new class, <code>A</code>, and a class instance named <code>myA</code>:</p>
   * <listing>
   *      dynamic class A {}
   *      trace(A.prototype.constructor);      // [class A]
   *      trace(A.prototype.constructor == A); // true
   *      var myA:A = new A();
   *      trace(myA.constructor == A);         // true</listing>
   * <p>Advanced users may choose to use the <code>function</code> keyword instead of the <code>class</code> keyword to define a Function object that can be used as a template for creating objects. Such a function is called a constructor function because you can use it in conjunction with the <code>new</code> operator to create objects. If you use the <code>function</code> keyword to create a constructor function, its prototype object is assigned a property named <code>constructor</code> that holds a reference to the constructor function. If you then use the constructor function to create an object, the object inherits the <code>constructor</code> property from the constructor function's prototype object. For example, the following code creates a new constructor function, <code>f</code>, and an object named <code>myF</code>:</p>
   * <listing>
   *      function f() {}
   *      trace(f.prototype.constructor);      // function Function() {}
   *      trace(f.prototype.constructor == f); // true
   *      var myF = new f();
   *      trace(myF.constructor == f);         // true</listing>
   * <p><b>Note</b>: The <code>constructor</code> property is writable, which means that user code can change its value with an assignment statement. Changing the value of the <code>constructor</code> property is not recommended, but if you write code that depends on the value of the <code>constructor</code> property, you should ensure that the value is not reset. The value can be changed only when the property is accessed through the prototype object (for example, <code>className.prototype.constructor</code>).</p>
   * <p>If you access the <code>constructor</code> property and compile in strict mode, you will get an error at compile time because the constructor property depends on the protoype object, which is a runtime entity. If you use standard mode or if the class description specifies "dynamic", the code runs without generating an error.</p>

   * Indicates whether an object has a specified property defined. This method returns <code>true</code> if the target object has a property that matches the string specified by the <code>name</code> parameter, and <code>false</code> otherwise. The following types of properties cause this method to return <code>true</code> for objects that are instances of a class (as opposed to class objects):
   * <ul>
   * <li>Fixed instance properties�variables, constants, or methods defined by the object's class that are not static;</li>
   * <li>Inherited fixed instance properties�variables, constants, or methods inherited by the object's class;</li>
   * <li>Dynamic properties�properties added to an object after it is instantiated (outside of its class definition). To add dynamic properties, the object's defining class must be declared with the <code>dynamic</code> keyword.</li></ul>
   * <p>The following types of properties cause this method to return <code>false</code> for objects that are instances of a class:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>Static properties�variables, constants, or methods defined with the static keyword in an object's defining class or any of its superclasses;</li>
   * <li>Prototype properties�properties defined on a prototype object that is part of the object's prototype chain. In ActionScript 3.0, the prototype chain is not used for class inheritance, but still exists as an alternative form of inheritance. For example, an instance of the Array class can access the <code>valueOf()</code> method because it exists on <code>Object.prototype</code>, which is part of the prototype chain for the Array class. Although you can use <code>valueOf()</code> on an instance of Array, the return value of <code>hasOwnProperty("valueOf")</code> for that instance is <code>false</code>.</li></ul>
   * <p>ActionScript 3.0 also has class objects, which are direct representations of class definitions. When called on class objects, the <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method returns <code>true</code> only if a property is a static property defined on that class object. For example, if you create a subclass of Array named CustomArray, and define a static property in CustomArray named <code>foo</code>, a call to <code>CustomArray.hasOwnProperty("foo")</code> returns <code>true</code>. For the static property <code>DESCENDING</code> defined in the Array class, however, a call to <code>CustomArray.hasOwnProperty("DESCENDING")</code> returns <code>false</code>.</p>
