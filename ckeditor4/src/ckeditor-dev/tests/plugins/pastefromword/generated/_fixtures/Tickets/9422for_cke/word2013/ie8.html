In the second module, the instructor discusses clinical issues related to informed consent, the therapeutic relationship, and managing crisis situations. Topics discussed in these two modules include appropriate assessment, diagnosis, and treatment considerations to create clinical safety. Relevant examples from malpractice suits and California Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) administrative cases are used to exemplify appropriate and reasonable clinical behavior.
