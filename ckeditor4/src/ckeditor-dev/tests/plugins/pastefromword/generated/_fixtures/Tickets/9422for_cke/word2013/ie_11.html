</font><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='color: windowtext; font-family: "Verdana",sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;'>This is the first module in a two-part series that explores
the legal and ethical parameters of the California standard of care, issues
related to confidentiality and privilege, and important legal concepts
including scope of practice, scope of competence, therapeutic duty, and mental
health case law for licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) and marriage and
family therapists (MFTs). In the second module, the instructor discusses clinical
issues related to informed consent, the therapeutic relationship, and managing
crisis situations. Topics discussed in these two modules include appropriate
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment considerations to create clinical safety.
Relevant examples from malpractice suits and California Board of Behavioral
Sciences (BBS) administrative cases are used to exemplify appropriate and
reasonable clinical behavior. It is recommended that readers complete both
modules.</span></p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">
