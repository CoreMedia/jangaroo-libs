Test if photo uploading works properly:

* Dropped image should be replaced by a temporary `upload widget` and by the final image (`image2` plugin) when upload is dome.
* `jpg`, `png`, `gif` and `bmp` files should be supported.
* Drop any other files. The link to the file should be inserted.
* Undo and redo during and after upload should work fine.
* It should be possible to format text and copy image during upload.
* If image is removed during upload, the process should be aborted.
* Check if you see a message about the progress, success and abort.
* Page shouldn't reload when image is drop on another one.

**Note:** This test use upload mock which will show you *Lena* instead of the real uploaded image or show the link to the *Lena* file.
