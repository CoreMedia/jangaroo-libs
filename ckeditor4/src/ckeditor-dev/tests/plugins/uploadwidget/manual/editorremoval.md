This test ensures that upload won't bleed if editor is destroyed during the upload.

1. Drop an image.
	* Note the editor will get automatically destroyed &mdash; that's fine ðŸ‘Œ
1. Wait until a message is logged in the _output_ section, no longer than 4 secs though.

## Expected

* _Output_ section contains "File upload  aborted" message.
* No exceptions were thrown.

## Unexpected

No message is logged or editor throws exceptions like:

`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'find' of null`
