1. Drag an image from the hard drive and drop it on disallowed UI elements:
 * toolbar (both static and floating),
 * bottom space,
 * dialog,
 * notification (use button to display).

**Expected:**
 * **Page shouldn't be reloaded!**
 * The `noâ€“drop` cursor is visible (except IE)

**Note:** This test uses upload mock, which means it shows a dummy image.
