Runaway auto grow bug test.

1. Click "Tab 1" to reveal the second editor.
2. Click inside the editor editable area to focus it.

Expected result:

The editor should have default height when revealed and when focused auto grow just enough to disable the vertical scrollbar.

Unexpected result to watch out for:

When revealed and before focusing the editor is very (over 9000px) high.
