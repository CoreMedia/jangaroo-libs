Play around with sliders to change square position.

## Expected:

The Balloon Toolbar always points at the red square.

## Unpexpected:

The Balloon Toolbar stays in same place when the square moves.

Note: Older IE's doesn't support input with type `range` so you need to enter numbers from keyboard.
