Drag one of the vertical borders separating the cells (inner borders) by holding the part in the first/last row.

**Expected**: Dragging by these parts is possible, the shadowy pillar created when dragging is the height of the table.

**Unexpected**: Dragging by these parts is not possible, the shadowy pillar is shorter than the height of the table.
