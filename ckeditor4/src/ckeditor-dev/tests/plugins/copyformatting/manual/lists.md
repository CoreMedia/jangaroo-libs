**Procedure**

Play with lists.

**Things to check**

* Styles are applied correctly even in the mixed context (e.g. selection begins in a paragraph and ends in a list).
* Inline styles from listitem (background color) are applied also to the text.
* Type of list is changed according to the type of list from which styles were copied.
* The list is not splitted into two after applying styles.
