		Apollo 11
		<br>
		<br>
		Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first humans, Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. <img height="20" alt="CKEditor logo" src="%BASE_PATH%_assets/logo.png" /> Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface 6 hours later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.
		<br>
		<br>
		Armstrong spent about three and a half two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, Aldrin slightly less; and together they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5&nbsp;kg) of lunar material for return to Earth. A third member of the mission, Michael Collins, piloted the command spacecraft alone in lunar orbit until Armstrong and Aldrin returned to it for the trip back to Earth.
		<br>
		<br>
		Broadcasting and quotes
		<br>
		<br>
		Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as:
		<br>
		<br>
		"One small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."
		<br>
		<br>
		Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the United States Congress:
		<br>
		<br>
		"[...] before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."
