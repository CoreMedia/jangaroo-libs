# Contributing to CKEditor

We are happy to see that you would like to contribute to CKEditor! CKEditor is an Open Source product that is free for
anyone to download, use, and customize. It has an amazing community around it that supports it in all possible ways.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that the workflow is as smooth and efficient as possible.

If you are preparing a pull request, see [Contributing Code and Providing Patches to CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_contributing_code.html).

If you would like to contribute in any other way, you can consider the following actions:

1. Create your own [plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/plugin_sdk_sample.html) or [skins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/skin_sdk_intro.html)
and submit them to [CKEditor Add-Ons Repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/).
2. Help localize CKEditor into your native language and update existing localizations by joining us at the
[CKEditor UI Translation Center](https://www.transifex.com/ckeditor/ckeditor/).
3. Join StackOverflow and share your knowledge with [fellow CKEditor users and developers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor).

**Your help will be much appreciated!**
