 * The Dictionary class lets you create a dynamic collection of properties, which uses strict equality (<code>===</code>) for key comparison. When an object is used as a key, the object's identity is used to look up the object, and not the value returned from calling <code>toString()</code> on it.
 * <p>The following statements show the relationship between a Dictionary object and a key object:</p>
 * <pre> var dict = new Dictionary();
 var obj = new Object();
 var key:Object = new Object();
 key.toString = function() { return "key" }

 dict[key] = "Letters";
 obj["key"] = "Letters";

 dict[key] == "Letters"; // true
 obj["key"] == "Letters"; // true
 obj[key] == "Letters"; // true because key == "key" is true b/c key.toString == "key"
 dict["key"] == "Letters"; // false because "key" === key is false
 delete dict[key]; //removes the key
 </pre>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Objects of the type QName are not valid values for keys in Dictionary object instances. Using a QName data type for a key generates a Reference error.</p>
