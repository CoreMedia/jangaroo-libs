/**
 * Use the Microphone class to monitor or capture audio from a microphone.
 * <p>To get a reference to a Microphone instance, use the <code>Microphone.getMicrophone()</code> method.</p>
 * <p>You can send microphone audio to a Flash Media Server. You can send the audio stream directly to the device audio output for local playback. You can also capture the audio stream for local recording or processing.</p>
 * <p><b>Sending microphone audio to Flash Media Server</b></p>
 * <p>Use the NetConnection and NetStream classes to transmit the audio stream to Flash Media Server. Flash Media Server can send the audio to other servers and broadcast it to other clients running Flash Player or Adobe AIR.</p>
 * <p><b>Playing microphone audio</b></p>
 * <p>Call the Microphone <code>setLoopback()</code> method to route the microphone audio directly to the computer or device audio output. Uncontrolled audio feedback is an inherent danger and is likely to occur whenever the audio output can be picked up by the microphone input. The <code>setUseEchoSuppression()</code> method can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of feedback amplification.</p>
 * <p><b>Capturing microphone audio</b></p>
 * <p>To capture microphone audio, listen for the <code>sampleData</code> events dispatched by a Microphone instance. The SampleDataEvent object dispatched for this event contains the audio data.</p>
 * <p>For information about capturing video, see the Camera class.</p>
 * <p><b>Runtime microphone support</b></p>
 * <p>The Microphone class is not supported in Flash Player running in a mobile browser.</p>
 * <p><i>AIR profile support:</i> The Microphone class is supported on desktop operating systems, but it is not supported on all mobile devices. It is not supported on AIR for TV devices. See <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS144092a96ffef7cc16ddeea2126bb46b82f-8000.html">AIR Profile Support</a> for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.</p>
 * <p>You can test for support at run time using the <code>Microphone.isSupported</code> property. Note that for AIR for TV devices, <code>Microphone.isSupported</code> is <code>true</code> but <code>Microphone.getMicrophone()</code> always returns <code>null</code>.</p>
 * <p><b>Privacy controls</b></p>
 * <p>Flash Player displays a Privacy dialog box that lets the user choose whether to allow or deny access to the microphone. Your application window size must be at least 215 x 138 pixels, the minimum size required to display the dialog box, or access is denied automatically.</p>
 * <p>Content running in the AIR application sandbox does not need permission to access the microphone and no dialog is displayed. AIR content running outside the application sandbox does require permission and the Privacy dialog is displayed.</p>

   * <p>In general, you should not pass a value for <code>index</code>. Simply call <code>air.Microphone.getMicrophone()</code> to return a reference to the default microphone. Using the Microphone Settings section in the Flash Player settings panel, the user can specify the default microphone the application should use. (The user access the Flash Player settings panel by right-clicking Flash Player content running in a web browser.) If you pass a value for <code>index</code>, you can reference a microphone other than the one the user chooses. You can use <code>index</code> in rare cases—for example, if your application is capturing audio from two microphones at the same time. Content running in Adobe AIR also uses the Flash Player setting for the default microphone.</p>
   * <p>When a SWF file tries to access the object returned by <code>Microphone.getMicrophone()</code> —for example, when you call <code>NetStream.attachAudio()</code>— Flash Player displays a Privacy dialog box that lets the user choose whether to allow or deny access to the microphone.

   * <p>When the user responds to this dialog box, a <code>status</code> event is dispatched that indicates the user's response. You can also check the <code>Microphone.muted</code> property to determine if the user has allowed or denied access to the microphone.</p>
   * <p>If <code>Microphone.getMicrophone()</code> returns <code>null</code>, either the microphone is in use by another application, or there are no microphones installed on the system.
