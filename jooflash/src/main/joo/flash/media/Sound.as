/**
 * The Sound class lets you work with sound in an application. The Sound class
 * lets you create a Sound object, load and play an external MP3 file into that object,
 * close the sound stream, and access
 * data about the sound, such as information about the number of bytes in the stream and
 * ID3 metadata. More detailed control of the sound is performed through the sound source —
 * the SoundChannel or Microphone object for the sound — and through the properties
 * in the SoundTransform class that control the output of the sound to the computer's speakers.
 *
 * <p>In Flash Player 10 and later and AIR 1.5 and later, you can also use this
 * class to work with sound that is generated dynamically.
 * In this case, the Sound object uses the function you assign to a <code>sampleData</code> event handler to
 * poll for sound data. The sound is played as it is retrieved from a ByteArray object that
 * you populate with sound data. You can use <code>Sound.extract()</code> to extract sound data from a
 * Sound object, after which you can manipulate it before writing it back to the stream for playback.</p>
 *
 * <p>To control sounds that are embedded in a SWF file, use the properties in the SoundMixer class.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note</b>: The ActionScript 3.0 Sound API differs from ActionScript 2.0.
 * In ActionScript 3.0, you cannot take sound objects and arrange them in a hierarchy
 * to control their properties.</p>
 *
 * <p>When you use this class, consider the following security model: </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in a network sandbox
 * and the sound file to be loaded is local.</li>
 * <li>By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is local and
 * tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant explicit permission to allow this type of access.</li>
 * <li>Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a loaded sound cannot
 * be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you implement a cross-domain policy file.
 * Sound-related APIs that fall under this restriction are <code>Sound.id3</code>,
 * <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>, <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code>,
 * and the <code>SoundTransform</code> class.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security sandbox (content
 * installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by these security limitations.</p>

   *
   * @example
   * In the following example, once the file is loaded, the user using a
   * graphic bar can select the starting position (starting time) of the sound file.
   *
   * <p>The constructor calls the <code>Sound.load()</code> method to start loading the sound data.
   * Next it calls the <code>Sound.play()</code> method which will start playing the sound as soon
   * as enough data has loaded. The <code>Sound.play()</code> method returns a SoundChannel object
   * that can be used to control the playback of the sound. The text field displays the instructions.
   * To make sure the content of where the user wants the sound to start, has already been loaded,
   * the <code>bar</code> Sprite object is created and displayed after the file has finished loading.
   * An <code>Event.COMPLETE</code> event is dispatched when the file is successfully loaded, which
   * triggers the <code>completeHandler()</code> method. The <code>completeHandler()</code> method
   * then creates the bar and adds it to the display list. (A sprite object is used instead of a shape
   * object to support interactivity.) When the user clicks on the bar, the <code>clickHandler()</code>
   * method is triggered.</p>
   *
   * <p>In the <code>clickHandler()</code> method, the position of x coordinate of the user's click,
   * <code>event.localX</code>, is used to determine where the user wants the file to start.
   * Since the bar is 100 pixels and it starts at x coordinate 100 pixels, it is easy to determine
   * the percentage of the position. Also, since the file is loaded, the <code>length</code>
   * property of the sound file will have the length of the complete file in milliseconds.
   * Using the length of the sound file and the position in the line, a starting position
   * for the sound file is determined. After stopping the sound from playing, the sound file
   * restarts at the selected starting position, which is past as the <code>startTime</code>
   * parameter to the <code>play()</code> method.</p>

   * event, which is used as the timing mechanism for showing playback progress. Finally, a third listener

   * property divided by the value of the <code>bytesTotal</code> property.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note that if the file is small, cached, or the file is in the local directory, the load progress
   * may not be noticeable. Also the lag time between when the sound data starts loading and the loaded
   * data starts playing is determined by the value of the <code>SoundLoaderContext.buffertime</code>
   * property, which is by default 1000 milliseconds and can be reset.</p>

     access to these tags through the format
     <code>my_sound.id3.COMM</code>, <code>my_sound.id3.TIME</code>, and so on. The first

     <p>When using this property, consider the Flash Player security model:</p>

     <ul><li>The <code>id3</code> property of a Sound object is always permitted for SWF files
     that are in the same security sandbox as the sound file. For files in other sandboxes, there
     are security checks.</li><li>When you load the sound, using the <code>load()</code> method of the Sound class, you can
     specify a <code>context</code> parameter, which is a SoundLoaderContext object. If you set the
     <code>checkPolicyFile</code>  property of the SoundLoaderContext object to <code>true</code>, Flash Player
     checks for a URL policy file on the server from which the sound is loaded. If a
     policy file exists and permits access from the domain of the loading SWF file, then the file is allowed
     to access the <code>id3</code> property of the Sound object; otherwise it is not.</li></ul>


     <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security sandbox (content
     installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by these security limitations.</p>

     <p>For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer Center Topic:
     <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en" target="external">Security</a>.</p>

     @example
   The following example reads the ID3 information from a sound file and displays
 it in a text field.

 <p>In the constructor, the sound file is loaded but it is not set to play. Here, it is
 assumed that the file is in the SWF directory. The system must have permission
 in order to read the ID3 tags of a loaded sound file. If there is ID3 information in
 the file and the program is permitted to read it, an <code>Event.ID3</code> event will
 be fired and the <code>id3</code> property of the sound file will be populated.
 The <code>id3</code> property contains an <code>ID3Info</code> object with all
 of the ID3 information.</p>

 <p>In the <code>id3Handler()</code> method, the file's ID3 tags
 are stored in <code>id3</code>, an ID3Info class object. A text field is
 instantiated to display the list of the ID3 tags. The for loop iterates
 through all the ID3 2.0 tags and appends the name and value to the content of
 the text field. Using ID3 info (<code>ID3Info</code>) properties, the artist,
 song name, and album are also appended. ActionScript 3.0
 and Flash Player 9 and later support ID3 2.0 tags, specifically 2.3 and 2.4.
 If you iterate through properties like in the for loop, only ID3 2.0 tags will appear.
 However, the data from the earlier versions are also stored in the song's <code>id3</code>
 property and can be accessed using ID3 info class properties.
 The tags for the ID3 1.0 are at the end of the file while the ID3 2.0 tags are in
 the beginning of the file. (Sometimes, the files may have both earlier and later version
 tags in the same place.) If a file encoded with both version 1.0 and 2.0 tags at the
 beginning and the end of the file, the method <code>id3Handler()</code> will be invoked twice.
 It first reads the 2.0 version and then the version 1.0. If only ID3 1.0 tag is available,
 then the information is accessible via the ID3 info properties, like <code>id3.songname</code>.
 For ID3 2.0, <code>id3.TITS</code> property will retrieve the song name using the new tag (TITS).</p>


 <p>Note that no error handling is written for this example and if the ID3 content is long,
 the result may go beyond the viewable area.</p>
