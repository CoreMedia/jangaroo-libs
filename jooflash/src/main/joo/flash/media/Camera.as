 * Use the Camera class to capture video from the client system's camera. Use the Video class to monitor the video locally. Use the NetConnection and NetStream classes to transmit the video to Flash Media Server. Flash Media Server can send the video stream to other servers and broadcast it to other clients running Flash Player.
 * <p>A Camera instance captures video in landscape aspect ratio. On devices that can change the screen orientation, such as mobile phones, a Video object attached to the camera will only show upright video in a landscape-aspect orientation. Thus, mobile apps should use a landscape orientation when displaying video and should not auto-rotate.</p>
 * <p>On Android, the camera does not capture video while an AIR app is not the active, foreground application.</p>
 * <p><b>Mobile Browser Support:</b> This class is not supported in mobile browsers.</p>
 * <p><i>AIR profile support:</i> This feature is supported on desktop operating systems, but it is not supported on all mobile devices. It is not supported on AIR for TV devices. See <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS144092a96ffef7cc16ddeea2126bb46b82f-8000.html">AIR Profile Support</a> for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.</p>
 * <p>You can test for support at run time using the <code>Camera.isSupported</code> property. Note that for AIR for TV devices, <code>Camera.isSupported</code> is <code>true</code> but <code>Camera.getCamera()</code> always returns <code>null</code>.</p>
 * <p>For information about capturing audio, see the Microphone class.</p>
 * <p><b>Important:</b> Flash Player displays a Privacy dialog box that lets the user choose whether to allow or deny access to the camera. Make sure your application window size is at least 215 x 138 pixels; this is the minimum size required to display the dialog box.</p>
 * <p>To create or reference a Camera object, use the <code>getCamera()</code> method.</p>

   * Returns a reference to a Camera object for capturing video. To begin capturing the video, you must attach the Camera object to a Video object (see <code>Video.attachCamera()</code> ). To transmit video to Flash Media Server, call <code>NetStream.attachCamera()</code> to attach the Camera object to a NetStream object.
   * <p>Multiple calls to the <code>getCamera()</code> method reference the same camera driver. Thus, if your code contains code like <code>firstCam:Camera = getCamera()</code> and <code>secondCam:Camera = getCamera()</code>, both <code>firstCam</code> and <code>secondCam</code> reference the same camera, which is the user's default camera.</p>
   * <p>In general, you shouldn't pass a value for the <code>name</code> parameter; simply use <code>getCamera()</code> to return a reference to the default camera. By means of the Camera settings panel (discussed later in this section), the user can specify the default camera to use.</p>
   * <p>You can't use ActionScript to set a user's Allow or Deny permission setting for access to the camera, but you can display the Adobe Flash Player Settings camera setting dialog box where the user can set the camera permission. When a SWF file using the <code>attachCamera()</code> method tries to attach the camera returned by the <code>getCamera()</code> method to a Video or NetStream object, Flash Player displays a dialog box that lets the user choose to allow or deny access to the camera. (Make sure your application window size is at least 215 x 138 pixels; this is the minimum size Flash Player requires to display the dialog box.) When the user responds to the camera setting dialog box, Flash Player returns an information object in the <code>status</code> event that indicates the user's response: <code>Camera.muted</code> indicates the user denied access to a camera; <code>Camera.Unmuted</code> indicates the user allowed access to a camera. To determine whether the user has denied or allowed access to the camera without handling the <code>status</code> event, use the <code>muted</code> property.</p>
   * <p>In Flash Player, the user can specify permanent privacy settings for a particular domain by right-clicking (Windows and Linux) or Control-clicking (Macintosh) while a SWF file is playing, selecting Settings, opening the Privacy dialog, and selecting Remember. If the user selects Remember, Flash Player no longer asks the user whether to allow or deny SWF files from this domain access to your camera.</p>
   * <p><b>Note:</b> The <code>attachCamera()</code> method will not invoke the dialog box to Allow or Deny access to the camera if the user has denied access by selecting Remember in the Flash Player Settings dialog box. In this case, you can prompt the user to change the Allow or Deny setting by displaying the Flash Player Privacy panel for the user using <code>Security.showSettings(SecurityPanel.PRIVACY)</code>.</p>
   * <p>If <code>getCamera()</code> returns <code>null</code>, either the camera is in use by another application, or there are no cameras installed on the system. To determine whether any cameras are installed, use the <code>names.length</code> property. To display the Flash Player Camera Settings panel, which lets the user choose the camera to be referenced by <code>getCamera()</code>, use <code>Security.showSettings(SecurityPanel.CAMERA)</code>.</p>
   * <p>Scanning the hardware for cameras takes time. When the runtime finds at least one camera, the hardware is not scanned again for the lifetime of the player instance. However, if the runtime doesn't find any cameras, it will scan each time <code>getCamera</code> is called. This is helpful if the camera is present but is disabled; if your SWF file provides a Try Again button that calls <code>getCamera</code>, Flash Player can find the camera without the user having to restart the SWF file.</p>
   * @param name Specifies which camera to get, as determined from the array returned by the <code>names</code> property. For most applications, get the default camera by omitting this parameter. To specify a value for this parameter, use the string representation of the zero-based index position within the Camera.names array. For example, to specify the third camera in the array, use <code>Camera.getCamera("2")</code>.
   *
   * @return If the <code>name</code> parameter is not specified, this method returns a reference to the default camera or, if it is in use by another application, to the first available camera. (If there is more than one camera installed, the user may specify the default camera in the Flash Player Camera Settings panel.) If no cameras are available or installed, the method returns <code>null</code>.

   * <td><code><b>status</b>:<a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/events/StatusEvent.html"><code>StatusEvent</code></a></code> — Dispatched when a camera reports its status. Before accessing a camera, Flash Player displays a Privacy dialog box to let users allow or deny access to their camera. If the value of the <code>code</code> property is <code>"Camera.muted"</code>, the user has refused to allow the SWF file access to the user's camera. If the value of the <code>code</code> property is <code>"Camera.Unmuted"</code>, the user has allowed the SWF file access to the user's camera.</td></tr></table>

   *
   * @example In the following example, after the user allows access to the camera, the attached camera is used to capture video images. Information about the video stream, such as the current frames per second, is also displayed.
   * <p>The <code>Camera.getCamera()</code> method returns a reference to a camera object, or returns null if no camera is available or installed. The if statement checks whether the camera was found and whether the user allowed access to the camera. If the user denied access, the <code>muted</code> property is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
   * <p>Usually, when the <code>attachCamera()</code> method is invoked, a dialog box appears and prompts the user to allow or deny Flash Player access to the camera. However, if the user denied access and selected the <code>Remember</code> option, the dialog box does not appear and nothing displays. To make sure the user has the option to allow access to the camera, the <code>myTextField</code> text field instructs the user to click the text field to invoke the Flash Player Settings dialog box.</p>
   * <p>The <code>clickHandler()</code> method calls <code>Security.showSettings()</code> method, which displays the <code>PRIVACY</code> panel of the Settings dialog box. If the user allows access, the <code>StatusEvent.STATUS</code> event is dispatched and the value of the event's <code>code</code> property is set to <code>Camera.Unmuted</code>. (The camera object's <code>mute</code> property is also set to <code>false</code>.)</p>
   * <p>The <code>statusHandler()</code> method, added to listen to the status change of the user's setting, invokes the <code>connectCamera()</code> method, if the user allows access. The <code>connectCamera()</code> method instantiates a video object with the captured stream's width and height. To display the camera's captured video, the reference to the video stream is attached to the video object, and the video object is added to the display list.</p>
   * <p>A Timer object also is started. Every second, a Timer object's timer event is dispatched and the <code>timerHandler()</code> method is invoked. The <code>timerHandler()</code> method is displayed and updates a number of properties of the Camera object.</p>
   * <p><b>Note:</b> For this example, the only property that changes is the <code>currentFPS</code> property.</p>

To maximize frame rate at the expense of camera height and width, pass <code>false</code> for the <code>favorArea</code> parameter.

   *
   * @example In the following example, when a user clicks on the Stage, the video is resized and the frames per second capture rate is set to a new value.
   * <p>The Stage is set so it does not scale. The <code>Camera.getCamera()</code> method returns a reference to a camera object, or returns null if no camera is available or installed. If a camera exists, the <code>connectCamera()</code> method is called. The <code>connectCamera()</code> method instantiates a video object. To display the camera's captured video, the reference to the video stream is attached to the video object, and the video object is added to the display list. An event listener also is set for a <code>MouseEvent.CLICK</code> event. After the user clicks on the Stage, the <code>clickHandler()</code> method is invoked. The method checks the width of the captured video and sets the camera capture mode's width, height, and the frame per second request rate. In order for these setting to take effect, the video object must be removed and re-created. The video's width and height also must be set to the camera object's width and height.</p>

  /**
   * Specifies how much motion is required to dispatch the <code>activity</code> event. Optionally sets the number of milliseconds that must elapse without activity before Flash Player considers motion to have stopped and dispatches the event.
   * <p><b>Note:</b> Video can be displayed regardless of the value of the <code>motionLevel</code> parameter. This parameter determines only when and under what circumstances the event is dispatched—not whether video is actually being captured or displayed.</p>
   * <p>To prevent the camera from detecting motion at all, pass a value of 100 for the <code>motionLevel</code> parameter; the <code>activity</code> event is never dispatched. (You would probably use this value only for testing purposes—for example, to temporarily disable any handlers that would normally be triggered when the event is dispatched.)</p>
   * <p>To determine the amount of motion the camera is currently detecting, use the <code>activityLevel</code> property. Motion sensitivity values correspond directly to activity values. Complete lack of motion is an activity value of 0. Constant motion is an activity value of 100. Your activity value is less than your motion sensitivity value when you're not moving; when you are moving, activity values frequently exceed your motion sensitivity value.</p>
   * <p>This method is similar in purpose to the <code>Microphone.setSilenceLevel()</code> method; both methods are used to specify when the <code>activity</code> event should be dispatched. However, these methods have a significantly different impact on publishing streams:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li><code>Microphone.setSilenceLevel()</code> is designed to optimize bandwidth. When an audio stream is considered silent, no audio data is sent. Instead, a single message is sent, indicating that silence has started.</li>
   * <li><code>Camera.setMotionLevel()</code> is designed to detect motion and does not affect bandwidth usage. Even if a video stream does not detect motion, video is still sent.</li></ul>
   * @param motionLevel Specifies the amount of motion required to dispatch the <code>activity</code> event. Acceptable values range from 0 to 100. The default value is 50.
   * @param timeout Specifies how many milliseconds must elapse without activity before Flash Player considers activity to have stopped and dispatches the <code>activity</code> event. The default value is 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).
   *
   * @see #motionLevel
   * @see #motionTimeout
   * @see Microphone#setSilenceLevel()
   *
   * @example In the following example, the user's camera is used as a monitor or a surveillance camera. The camera detects motion and a text field shows the activity level. (The example can be extended to sound an alarm or send a message through a web service to other applications.)
   * <p>The <code>Camera.getCamera()</code> method returns a reference to a camera object, or returns null if no camera is available or installed. The if statement checks whether a camera is available, and invokes the <code>connectCamera()</code> method when it is available. The <code>connectCamera()</code> method instantiates a video object with the captured stream's width and height. To display the camera's captured video, the reference to the video stream is attached to the video object, and the video object is added to the display list. (Usually, when the <code>attachCamera()</code> method is invoked, a dialog box appears and prompts the user to allow or deny Flash Player access to the camera. However, if the user denied access and selected the <code>Remember</code> option, the dialog box does not appear and nothing is displayed. To make sure the user has the option to allow access to the camera, use the <code>system.Security.showSettings()</code> method to invoke the Flash Player Settings dialog box.)</p>
   * <p>The <code>setMotionLevel()</code> method sets the level of activity (amount of motion), before the activity event is invoked, to five, for minimal motion. The time between when the camera stops detecting motion and when the activity event is invoked, is set to 1 second (1000 millisecond). After 1 second passes without activity or the level of activity reaches five, the <code>ActivityEvent.ACTIVITY</code> event is dispatched and the <code>activityHandler()</code> method is invoked. If the event was triggered by the level of activity, the <code>activating</code> property is set to <code>true</code> and a Timer object is started. Every second, a Timer objectÃ¢â‚¬™s timer event is dispatched and the <code>timerHandler()</code> method is invoked, which displays the current level of activity. (Although a level of five or larger triggers the timer, the displayed current level of activity might be a smaller number.)</p>
