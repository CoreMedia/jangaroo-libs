/**
 * The Video class displays live or recorded video in an application without embedding the video in your SWF file. This class creates a Video object that plays either of the following kinds of video: recorded video files stored on a server or locally, or live video captured by the user. A Video object is a display object on the application's display list and represents the visual space in which the video runs in a user interface.
 * <p>When used with Flash Media Server, the Video object allows you to send live video captured by a user to the server and then broadcast it from the server to other users. Using these features, you can develop media applications such as a simple video player, a video player with multipoint publishing from one server to another, or a video sharing application for a user community.</p>
 * <p>Flash Player 9 and later supports publishing and playback of FLV files encoded with either the Sorenson Spark or On2 VP6 codec and also supports an alpha channel. The On2 VP6 video codec uses less bandwidth than older technologies and offers additional deblocking and deringing filters. See the flash.net.NetStream class for more information about video playback and supported formats.</p>
 * <p>Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and later supports mipmapping to optimize runtime rendering quality and performance. For video playback, Flash Player uses mipmapping optimization if you set the Video object's <code>smoothing</code> property to <code>true</code>.</p>
 * <p>As with other display objects on the display list, you can control various properties of Video objects. For example, you can move the Video object around on the Stage by using its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties, you can change its size using its <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> properties, and so on.</p>
 * <p>To play a video stream, use <code>attachCamera()</code> or <code>attachNetStream()</code> to attach the video to the Video object. Then, add the Video object to the display list using <code>addChild()</code>.</p>
 * <p>If you are using Flash Professional, you can also place the Video object on the Stage rather than adding it with <code>addChild()</code>, like this:</p><ol>
 * <li>If the Library panel isn't visible, select Window > Library to display it.</li>
 * <li>Add an embedded Video object to the library by clicking the Options menu on the right side of the Library panel title bar and selecting New Video.</li>
 * <li>In the Video Properties dialog box, name the embedded Video object for use in the library and click OK.</li>
 * <li>Drag the Video object to the Stage and use the Property Inspector to give it a unique instance name, such as <code>my_video</code>. (Do not name it Video.)</li></ol>
 * <p>In AIR applications on the desktop, playing video in fullscreen mode disables any power and screen saving features (when allowed by the operating system).</p>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The Video class is not a subclass of the InteractiveObject class, so it cannot dispatch mouse events. However, you can call the <code>addEventListener()</code> method on the display object container that contains the Video object.</p>

public class Video extends DisplayObject {
  /**
   * Indicates the type of filter applied to decoded video as part of post-processing. The default value is 0, which lets the video compressor apply a deblocking filter as needed.
   * <p>Compression of video can result in undesired artifacts. You can use the <code>deblocking</code> property to set filters that reduce blocking and, for video compressed using the On2 codec, ringing.</p>
   * <p><i>Blocking</i> refers to visible imperfections between the boundaries of the blocks that compose each video frame. <i>Ringing</i> refers to distorted edges around elements within a video image.</p>
   * <p>Two deblocking filters are available: one in the Sorenson codec and one in the On2 VP6 codec. In addition, a deringing filter is available when you use the On2 VP6 codec. To set a filter, use one of the following values:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>0—Lets the video compressor apply the deblocking filter as needed.</li>
   * <li>1—Does not use a deblocking filter.</li>
   * <li>2—Uses the Sorenson deblocking filter.</li>
   * <li>3—For On2 video only, uses the On2 deblocking filter but no deringing filter.</li>
   * <li>4—For On2 video only, uses the On2 deblocking and deringing filter.</li>
   * <li>5—For On2 video only, uses the On2 deblocking and a higher-performance On2 deringing filter.</li></ul>
   * <p>If a value greater than 2 is selected for video when you are using the Sorenson codec, the Sorenson decoder defaults to 2.</p>
   * <p>Using a deblocking filter has an effect on overall playback performance, and it is usually not necessary for high-bandwidth video. If a user's system is not powerful enough, the user may experience difficulties playing back video with a deblocking filter enabled.</p>
