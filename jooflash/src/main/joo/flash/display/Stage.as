/**
 * The Stage class represents the main drawing area.
 * <p>For SWF content running in the browser (in Flash<sup>®</sup> Player), the Stage represents the entire area where Flash content is shown. For content running in AIR on desktop operating systems, each NativeWindow object has a corresponding Stage object.</p>
 * <p>The Stage object is not globally accessible. You need to access it through the <code>stage</code> property of a DisplayObject instance.</p>
 * <p>The Stage class has several ancestor classes — DisplayObjectContainer, InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and EventDispatcher — from which it inherits properties and methods. Many of these properties and methods are either inapplicable to Stage objects, or require security checks when called on a Stage object. The properties and methods that require security checks are documented as part of the Stage class.</p>
 * <p>In addition, the following inherited properties are inapplicable to Stage objects. If you try to set them, an IllegalOperationError is thrown. These properties may always be read, but since they cannot be set, they will always contain default values.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>accessibilityProperties</code></li>
 * <li><code>alpha</code></li>
 * <li><code>blendMode</code></li>
 * <li><code>cacheAsBitmap</code></li>
 * <li><code>contextMenu</code></li>

 * <li><code>transform</code></li>
 * <li><code>visible</code></li>
 * <li><code>x</code></li>
 * <li><code>y</code></li></ul>
 * <p>Some events that you might expect to be a part of the Stage class, such as <code>enterFrame</code>, <code>exitFrame</code>, <code>frameConstructed</code>, and <code>render</code>, cannot be Stage events because a reference to the Stage object cannot be guaranteed to exist in every situation where these events are used. Because these events cannot be dispatched by the Stage object, they are instead dispatched by every DisplayObject instance, which means that you can add an event listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for these events. These events, which are part of the DisplayObject class, are called broadcast events to differentiate them from events that target a specific DisplayObject instance. Two other broadcast events, <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code>, belong to DisplayObject's superclass, EventDispatcher. The <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> events behave similarly to the DisplayObject broadcast events, except that these two events are dispatched not only by all DisplayObject instances, but also by all EventDispatcher instances and instances of other EventDispatcher subclasses. For more information on broadcast events, see the DisplayObject class.</p>

   * <li><code>StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE</code> Sets the AIR application to expand the stage over the user's entire screen, with keyboard input allowed. (Not available for content running in Flash Player.)</li>
   * <li><code>StageDisplayState.NORMAL</code> Sets the Flash runtime back to the standard stage display mode.</li></ul>
   * <p>The scaling behavior of the movie in full-screen mode is determined by the <code>scaleMode</code> setting (set using the <code>Stage.scaleMode</code> property or the SWF file's <code>embed</code> tag settings in the HTML file). If the <code>scaleMode</code> property is set to <code>noScale</code> while the application transitions to full-screen mode, the Stage <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are updated, and the Stage the <code>resize</code> event.</p>
   * <p>The following restrictions apply to SWF files that play within an HTML page (not those using the stand-alone Flash Player or not running in the AIR runtime):</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>To enable full-screen mode, add the <code>allowFullScreen</code> parameter to the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that includes the SWF file, with <code>allowFullScreen</code> set to <code>"true"</code>, as shown in the following example:
   * <listing>
   * <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
   *           ...
   *     <embed src="example.swf" allowFullScreen="true" ... ></listing>
   * <p>An HTML page may also use a script to generate SWF-embedding tags. You need to alter the script so that it inserts the proper <code>allowFullScreen</code> settings. HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and Flash Builder use the <code>AC_FL_RunContent()</code> function to embed references to SWF files, and you need to add the <code>allowFullScreen</code> parameter settings, as in the following:</p>
   * <listing>
   * AC_FL_RunContent( ... "allowFullScreen", "true", ... )</listing></li>
   * <li>Full-screen mode is initiated in response to a mouse click or key press by the user; the movie cannot change <code>Stage.displayState</code> without user input. Flash runtimes restrict keyboard input in full-screen mode. Acceptable keys include keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode and non-printing keys such as arrows, space, Shift, and Tab keys. Keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode are: Escape (Windows, Linux, and Mac), Control+W (Windows), Command+W (Mac), and Alt+F4.
   * <p>A Flash runtime dialog box appears over the movie when users enter full-screen mode to inform the users they are in full-screen mode and that they can press the Escape key to end full-screen mode.</p></li>
   * <li>Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, full-screen works the same in windowless mode as it does in window mode. If you set the Window Mode (<code>wmode</code> in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless (<code>opaque</code>) or Transparent Windowless (<code>transparent</code>), full-screen can be initiated, but the full-screen window will always be opaque.</li></ul>
   * <p>These restrictions are <i>not</i> present for SWF content running in the stand-alone Flash Player or in AIR. AIR supports an interactive full-screen mode which allows keyboard input.</p>
   * <p>For AIR content running in full-screen mode, the system screen saver and power saving options are disabled while video content is playing and until either the video stops or full-screen mode is exited.</p>
   * <p>On Linux, setting <code>displayState</code> to <code>StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN</code> or <code>StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE</code> is an asynchronous operation.</p>
   * @throws SecurityError Calling the <code>displayState</code> property of a Stage object throws an exception for any caller that is not in the same security sandbox as the Stage owner (the main SWF file). To avoid this, the Stage owner can grant permission to the domain of the caller by calling the <code>Security.allowDomain()</code> method or the <code>Security.allowInsecureDomain()</code> method. For more information, see the "Security" chapter in the <i>ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide</i>. Trying to set the <code>displayState</code> property while the settings dialog is displayed, without a user response, or if the <code>param</code> or <code>embed</code> HTML tag's <code>allowFullScreen</code> attribute is not set to <code>true</code> throws a security error.

Clicking the red square triggers the <code>enterFullScreen()</code> event handler, which sets the <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property and enters full screen mode. To set the <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property, the event handler starts with the location and dimensions of the red square. It then compares the aspect ratio (width divided by height) of the red square to the aspect ratio of the stage at full screen width and height so that it can expand the rectangle (<code>fullScreenSourceRect</code>) to match the screen's aspect ratio. The result is that the red square occupies the entire height of the monitor with the green background visible on each side. If the aspect ratio was not matched, the stage background color, which is white by default, would show on each side instead of the green background.

   * <p>When this property is set to a valid rectangle and the <code>displayState</code> property is set to full-screen mode, the Flash runtime scales the specified area. The actual Stage size in pixels within ActionScript does not change. The Flash runtime enforces a minimum limit for the size of the rectangle to accommodate the standard "Press Esc to exit full-screen mode" message. This limit is usually around 260 by 30 pixels but can vary on platform and Flash runtime version.</p>
   * <p>This property can only be set when the Flash runtime is not in full-screen mode. To use this property correctly, set this property first, then set the <code>displayState</code> property to full-screen mode, as shown in the code examples.</p>

   * <div>In the following example, the user can switch between playing a video in full or normal screen mode by clicking on the stage. If the SWF for this example is running in Flash Player 9.0.115.0 or later, then it will use hardware acceleration to improve the full-screen scaling of the display.
   * <p>Before using the full-screen mode with hardware scaling, the following conditions must be met:</p><ol>
   * <li>Flash Player version 9.0.115.0 or later is needed, as well as an authoring tool that supports it.</li>
   * <li>HTML templates need to be modified to support full screen. The <code>allowFullScreen</code> attribute must be set to <code>true</code> for the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tag. (The scripts that generate SWF-embedding tags must also allow for full screen.) For sample of files that can be used for Flash Builder, see the article, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/full_screen_mode.html">Exploring full-screen mode in Flash Player 9</a>.</li>
   * <li>Your application must have permission and access to an FLV video file. In this example, it is assumed that Flash Video (FLV) file is in the same directory as the SWF file.</li>
   * <li>The user must allow access to full screen.</li>
   * <li>For additional information on hardware scaling, see the article <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/hardware_scaling_en">Exploring Flash Player support for high-definition H.264 video and AAC audio</a> for Flash Player.</li></ol>
   * <p>An FLV file is loaded using NetConnection and NetStream objects. Since the FLV file is in the same directory as the SWF file and will connect via HTTP, the <code>NetConnection.connect()</code> method's parameter is set to <code>null</code>. The <code>connect</code> NetConnection object reports its status by dispatching a <code>netStatus</code> event which invokes the <code>netStatusHandler()</code> method. The <code>netStatusHandler()</code> method checks if the connection was successful and invokes <code>connectStream()</code> method, which creates a NetStream object that takes the NetConnection object as a parameter. It also creates a video object and attached the NetStream object to the video object. The video object then is added to the display list and the stream is set to play. Since the FLV video file does not contain metadata or cue point information, an <code>AsyncError</code> event will be dispatched. A listener must be set up to handle the event. Here the listener is set up and it ignores the event. Another listener for <code>netStatus</code> event is also set up for the NetStream object. It will display an error message if the stream was not found. (Note that <code>netStatusHandler()</code> could be used to handle any number of different status information reported for the stream or connection.)</p>
   * <p>When the properties and methods of a loaded SWF file are accessible, the <code>createMouseListener()</code> method is invoked. It sets up an event listener for when the mouse is clicked on the stage. The <code>toggleFullScreen()</code> method checks if the display state is in the full or normal screen mode. If it is normal, the size of the video object is set to the size of the video stream. The <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property is set to a rectangle matching the dimensions of the video object. Then the <code>Stage.displayMode</code> property is set to full screen, which causes the video in the source rectangle to expand to fill the full screen area. If system requirements are met, the machine's graphics hardware will be used to improve the performance of the full-screen video rendering and the display state is set to full-screen mode. In order to catch any security error that may occur while switching to the full-screen mode, a <code>try...catch</code> is used. (Note that the display state must be set to full-screen mode after the <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property is set.) Before switching to the normal-screen mode, the video object's width and height are set back to the saved original video object's width and height. Otherwise, the changes made to the video object for the full-screen mode will determine the width and height.</p>

If you retrieve the value in an event handler that sets <code>Stage.displayState</code> to <code>StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN</code>, the value will be correct.</p>
   * <p>This is the pixel width of the monitor and is the same as the stage width would be if <code>Stage.align</code> is set to <code>StageAlign.TOP_LEFT</code> and <code>Stage.scaleMode</code> is set to <code>StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE</code>.</p>

   * @example This example creates a green rectangle the size of the stage and places a red square on it that it activates as a button. Clicking the red square triggers the <code>enterFullScreen()</code> event handler, which sets the <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property and enters full screen mode. To set the <code>fullScreenSourceRect</code> property, the event handler starts with the location and dimensions of the red square. It then compares the aspect ratio (width divided by height) of the red square to the aspect ratio of the stage at full screen width and height so that it can expand the rectangle (<code>fullScreenSourceRect</code>) to match the screen's aspect ratio. The result is that the red square occupies the entire height of the monitor with the green background visible on each side. If the aspect ratio was not matched, the stage background color, which is white by default, would show on each side instead of the green background.

  /**
   * Registers an event listener object with an EventDispatcher object so that the listener receives notification of an event. You can register event listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event, phase, and priority.
   * <p>After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change its priority through additional calls to <code>addEventListener()</code>. To change a listener's priority, you must first call <code>removeListener()</code>. Then you can register the listener again with the new priority level.</p>
   * <p>Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to <code>addEventListener()</code> with a different <code>type</code> or <code>useCapture</code> value result in the creation of a separate listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with <code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>, it listens only during the capture phase. If you call <code>addEventListener()</code> again using the same listener object, but with <code>useCapture</code> set to <code>false</code>, you have two separate listeners: one that listens during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and bubbling phases.</p>
   * <p>You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.</p>
   * <p>If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling <code>removeEventListener()</code>, or memory problems could result. Event listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object exists (unless the <code>useWeakReference</code> parameter is set to <code>true</code>).</p>
   * <p>Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners attached to it. (If your newly created node needs an event listener, you must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along with it.</p>
   * <p>If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during the current phase but can be triggered during a later phase in the event flow, such as the bubbling phase.</p>
   * <p>If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions. After it is removed, the event listener is never invoked again (unless registered again for future processing).</p>
   * @param type The type of event.
   * @param listener The listener function that processes the event. This function must accept an Event object as its only parameter and must return nothing, as this example shows:
   * <listing>
   * function(evt:Event):void</listing>
   * <p>The function can have any name.</p>
   * @param useCapture Determines whether the listener works in the capture phase or the target and bubbling phases. If <code>useCapture</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the listener processes the event only during the capture phase and not in the target or bubbling phase. If <code>useCapture</code> is <code>false</code>, the listener processes the event only during the target or bubbling phase. To listen for the event in all three phases, call <code>addEventListener</code> twice, once with <code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>, then again with <code>useCapture</code> set to <code>false</code>.
   * @param priority The priority level of the event listener. The priority is designated by a signed 32-bit integer. The higher the number, the higher the priority. All listeners with priority <i>n</i> are processed before listeners of priority <i>n</i>-1. If two or more listeners share the same priority, they are processed in the order in which they were added. The default priority is 0.
   * @param useWeakReference Determines whether the reference to the listener is strong or weak. A strong reference (the default) prevents your listener from being garbage-collected. A weak reference does not.
   * <p>Class-level member functions are not subject to garbage collection, so you can set <code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code> for class-level member functions without subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set <code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code> for a listener that is a nested inner function, the function will be garbage-collected and no longer persistent. If you create references to the inner function (save it in another variable) then it is not garbage-collected and stays persistent.</p>
