/**
 * The FileReference class provides a means to upload and download files between a user's computer and a server. An operating-system dialog box prompts the user to select a file to upload or a location for download. Each FileReference object refers to a single file on the user's disk and has properties that contain information about the file's size, type, name, creation date, modification date, and creator type (Macintosh only).
 * <p><b>Note:</b> In Adobe AIR, the File class, which extends the FileReference class, provides more capabilities and has less security restrictions than the FileReference class.</p>
 * <p>FileReference instances are created in the following ways:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When you use the <code>new</code> operator with the FileReference constructor: <code>var myFileReference = new FileReference();</code></li>
 * <li>When you call the <code>FileReferenceList.browse()</code> method, which creates an array of FileReference objects.</li></ul>
 * <p>During an upload operation, all the properties of a FileReference object are populated by calls to the <code>FileReference.browse()</code> or <code>FileReferenceList.browse()</code> methods. During a download operation, the <code>name</code> property is populated when the <code>select</code> event is dispatched; all other properties are populated when the <code>complete</code> event is dispatched.</p>
 * <p>The <code>browse()</code> method opens an operating-system dialog box that prompts the user to select a file for upload. The <code>FileReference.browse()</code> method lets the user select a single file; the <code>FileReferenceList.browse()</code> method lets the user select multiple files. After a successful call to the <code>browse()</code> method, call the <code>FileReference.upload()</code> method to upload one file at a time. The <code>FileReference.download()</code> method prompts the user for a location to save the file and initiates downloading from a remote URL.</p>
 * <p>The FileReference and FileReferenceList classes do not let you set the default file location for the dialog box that the <code>browse()</code> or <code>download()</code> methods generate. The default location shown in the dialog box is the most recently browsed folder, if that location can be determined, or the desktop. The classes do not allow you to read from or write to the transferred file. They do not allow the SWF file that initiated the upload or download to access the uploaded or downloaded file or the file's location on the user's disk.</p>
 * <p>The FileReference and FileReferenceList classes also do not provide methods for authentication. With servers that require authentication, you can download files with the Flash<sup>Â®</sup> Player browser plug-in, but uploading (on all players) and downloading (on the stand-alone or external player) fails. Listen for FileReference events to determine whether operations complete successfully and to handle errors.</p>
 * <p>For content running in Flash Player or for content running in Adobe AIR outside of the application security sandbox, uploading and downloading operations can access files only within its own domain and within any domains that a URL policy file specifies. Put a policy file on the file server if the content initiating the upload or download doesn't come from the same domain as the file server.</p>
 * <p>Note that because of new functionality added to the Flash Player, when publishing to Flash Player 10, you can have only one of the following operations active at one time: <code>FileReference.browse()</code>, <code>FileReference.upload()</code>, <code>FileReference.download()</code>, <code>FileReference.load()</code>, <code>FileReference.save()</code>. Otherwise, Flash Player throws a runtime error (code 2174). Use <code>FileReference.cancel()</code> to stop an operation in progress. This restriction applies only to Flash Player 10. Previous versions of Flash Player are unaffected by this restriction on simultaneous multiple operations.</p>
 * <p>While calls to the <code>FileReference.browse()</code>, <code>FileReferenceList.browse()</code>, or <code>FileReference.download()</code> methods are executing, SWF file playback pauses in stand-alone and external versions of Flash Player and in AIR for Linux and Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier</p>

When the user selects a location and confirms the download operation (for example, by clicking Save), the download from the remote server begins. Listeners receive events to indicate the progress, success, or failure of the download.

   * <p><b>Note</b>: If your server requires user authentication, only SWF files running in a browser â that is, using the browser plug-in or ActiveX control â can provide a dialog box to prompt the user for a user name and password for authentication, and only for downloads. For uploads using the plug-in or ActiveX control, or for uploads and downloads using the stand-alone or external player, the file transfer fails.</p>
   * <p>When you use this method , consider the Flash Player security model:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>Loading operations are not allowed if the calling SWF file is in an untrusted local sandbox.</li>
   * <li>The default behavior is to deny access between sandboxes. A website can enable access to a resource by adding a URL policy file.</li>
   * <li>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the <code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF content.</li>
   * <li>In Flash Player 10 and Flash Player 9 Update 5, you can only call this method successfully in response to a user event (for example, in an event handler for a mouse click or keypress event). Otherwise, calling this method results in Flash Player throwing an Error exception.</li></ul>
   * <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security sandbox (content installed with the AIR application) is not restricted by these security limitations.</p>
   * <p>For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer Center Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en">Security</a>.</p>

   * @throws flash.errors.MemoryError This error can occur for the following reasons: 1) Flash Player cannot convert the <code>URLRequest.data</code> parameter from UTF8 to MBCS. This error is applicable if the URLRequest object passed to the <code>FileReference.download()</code> method is set to perform a GET operation and if <code>System.useCodePage</code> is set to <code>true</code>. 2) Flash Player cannot allocate memory for the <code>POST</code> data. This error is applicable if the URLRequest object passed to the <code>FileReference.download()</code> method is set to perform a <code>POST</code> operation.
   * @throws Error If the method is not called in response to a user action, such as a mouse event or keypress event.

  /**
   * Starts the upload of the file to a remote server. Although Flash Player has no restriction on the size of files you can upload or download, the player officially supports uploads or downloads of up to 100 MB. You must call the <code>FileReference.browse()</code> or <code>FileReferenceList.browse()</code> method before you call this method.
   * <p>For the Adobe AIR File class, which extends the FileReference class, you can use the <code>upload()</code> method to upload any file. For the FileReference class (used in Flash Player), the user must first select a file.</p>
   * <p>Listeners receive events to indicate the progress, success, or failure of the upload. Although you can use the FileReferenceList object to let users select multiple files for upload, you must upload the files one by one; to do so, iterate through the <code>FileReferenceList.fileList</code> array of FileReference objects.</p>
   * <p>The <code>FileReference.upload()</code> and <code>FileReference.download()</code> functions are nonblocking. These functions return after they are called, before the file transmission is complete. In addition, if the FileReference object goes out of scope, any upload or download that is not yet completed on that object is canceled upon leaving the scope. Be sure that your FileReference object remains in scope for as long as the upload or download is expected to continue.</p>
   * <p>The file is uploaded to the URL passed in the <code>url</code> parameter. The URL must be a server script configured to accept uploads. Flash Player uploads files by using the HTTP <code>POST</code> method. The server script that handles the upload should expect a <code>POST</code> request with the following elements:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li><code>Content-Type</code> of <code>multipart/form-data</code></li>
   * <li><code>Content-Disposition</code> with a <code>name</code> attribute set to <code>"Filedata"</code> by default and a <code>filename</code> attribute set to the name of the original file</li>
   * <li>The binary contents of the file</li></ul>
   * <p>You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of blocked ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the <i>ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
   * <p>For a sample <code>POST</code> request, see the description of the <code>uploadDataFieldName</code> parameter. You can send <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> parameters to the server with the <code>upload()</code> method; see the description of the <code>request</code> parameter.</p>
   * <p>If the <code>testUpload</code> parameter is <code>true</code>, and the file to be uploaded is bigger than approximately 10 KB, Flash Player on Windows first sends a test upload <code>POST</code> operation with zero content before uploading the actual file, to verify that the transmission is likely to succeed. Flash Player then sends a second <code>POST</code> operation that contains the actual file content. For files smaller than 10 KB, Flash Player performs a single upload <code>POST</code> with the actual file content to be uploaded. Flash Player on Macintosh does not perform test upload <code>POST</code> operations.</p>
   * <p><b>Note</b>: If your server requires user authentication, only SWF files running in a browser â that is, using the browser plug-in or ActiveX control â can provide a dialog box to prompt the user for a username and password for authentication, and only for downloads. For uploads using the plug-in or ActiveX control, or for uploads and downloads using the stand-alone or external player, the file transfer fails.</p>
   * <p>When you use this method , consider the Flash Player security model:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>Loading operations are not allowed if the calling SWF file is in an untrusted local sandbox.</li>
   * <li>The default behavior is to deny access between sandboxes. A website can enable access to a resource by adding a URL policy file.</li>
   * <li>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the <code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF content.</li></ul>
   * <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security sandbox (content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by these security limitations.</p>
   * <p>For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer Center Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en">Security</a>.</p>
   * <p>Note that because of new functionality added to the Flash Player, when publishing to Flash Player 10, you can have only one of the following operations active at one time: <code>FileReference.browse()</code>, <code>FileReference.upload()</code>, <code>FileReference.download()</code>, <code>FileReference.load()</code>, <code>FileReference.save()</code>. Otherwise, Flash Player throws a runtime error (code 2174). Use <code>FileReference.cancel()</code> to stop an operation in progress. This restriction applies only to Flash Player 10. Previous versions of Flash Player are unaffected by this restriction on simultaneous multiple operations.</p>
   * @param request The URLRequest object; the <code>url</code> property of the URLRequest object should contain the URL of the server script configured to handle upload through HTTP <code>POST</code> calls. On some browsers, URL strings are limited in length. Lengths greater than 256 characters may fail on some browsers or servers. If this parameter is <code>null</code>, an exception is thrown. The <code>requestHeaders</code> property of the URLRequest object is ignored; custom HTTP request headers are not supported in uploads or downloads.
   * <p>The URL can be HTTP or, for secure uploads, HTTPS. To use HTTPS, use an HTTPS url in the <code>url</code> parameter. If you do not specify a port number in the <code>url</code> parameter, port 80 is used for HTTP and port 443 us used for HTTPS, by default.</p>
   * <p>To send <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> parameters to the server, set the <code>data</code> property of the URLRequest object to your parameters, and set the <code>method</code> property to either <code>URLRequestMethod.POST</code> or <code>URLRequestMethod.GET</code>.</p>
   * @param uploadDataFieldName The field name that precedes the file data in the upload <code>POST</code> operation. The <code>uploadDataFieldName</code> value must be non-null and a non-empty String. By default, the value of <code>uploadDataFieldName</code> is <code>"Filedata"</code>, as shown in the following sample <code>POST</code> request:
   * <pre>    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x
   --AaB03x
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Filedata"; filename="example.jpg"
   Content-Type: application/octet-stream
   ... contents of example.jpg ...
   --AaB03x--
   </pre>
   * @param testUpload A setting to request a test file upload. If <code>testUpload</code> is <code>true</code>, for files larger than 10 KB, Flash Player attempts a test file upload <code>POST</code> with a Content-Length of 0. The test upload checks whether the actual file upload will be successful and that server authentication, if required, will succeed. A test upload is only available for Windows players.
