 * <li>Call <code>NetStream.appendBytes()</code> to pass ByteArray data into the NetStream.</li></ul>
 * <p><b>Note:</b>You cannot play and publish a stream over the same NetStream object.</p>
 * <p>Adobe AIR and Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and later versions support files derived from the standard MPEG-4 container format. These files include F4V, MP4, M4A, MOV, MP4V, 3GP, and 3G2 if they contain H.264 video, HEAAC v2 encoded audio, or both. H.264 delivers higher quality video at lower bit rates when compared to the same encoding profile in Sorenson or On2. AAC is a standard audio format defined in the MPEG-4 video standard. HE-AAC v2 is an extension of AAC that uses Spectral Band Replication (SBR) and Parametric Stereo (PS) techniques to increase coding efficiency at low bit rates.</p>

 * <p><b>Receiving data from a Flash Media Server stream, progressive F4V file, or progressive FLV file</b></p>
 * <p>Flash Media Server, F4V files, and FLV files can send event objects containing data at specific data points during streaming or playback. You can handle data from a stream or FLV file during playback in two ways:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Associate a client property with an event handler to receive the data object. Use the <code>NetStream.client</code> property to assign an object to call specific data handling functions. The object assigned to the <code>NetStream.client</code> property can listen for the following data points: <code>onCuePoint()</code>, <code>onImageData()</code>, <code>onMetaData()</code>, <code>onPlayStatus()</code>, <code>onSeekPoint()</code>, <code>onTextData()</code>, and <code>onXMPData()</code>. Write procedures within those functions to handle the data object returned from the stream during playback. See the <code>NetStream.client</code> property for more information.</li>
 * <li>Associate a client property with a subclass of the NetStream class, then write an event handler to receive the data object. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler to an instance of the subclass.</li></ul>
 * <p>Wait to receive a <code>NetGroup.Neighbor.Connect</code> event before you use the object replication, direct routing, or posting APIs.</p>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> To send data through an audio file, like an mp3 file, use the Sound class to associate the audio file with a Sound object. Then, use the <code>Sound.id3</code> property to read metadata from the sound file.</p>

  /**
   * Specifies how long to buffer messages before starting to display the stream.
   * <p>The default value is 0.1 (one-tenth of a second). To determine the number of seconds currently in the buffer, use the <code>bufferLength</code> property.</p>
   * <p>To play a server-side playlist, set <code>bufferTime</code> to at least 1 second. If you experience playback issues, increase the length of <code>bufferTime</code>.</p>
   * <p><b>Recorded content</b> To avoid distortion when streaming pre-recorded (not live) content, do not set the value of <code>Netstream.bufferTime</code> to 0. By default, the application uses an input buffer for pre-recorded content that queues the media data and plays the media properly. For pre-recorded content, use the default setting or increase the buffer time.</p>
   * <p><b>Live content</b> When streaming live content, set the <code>bufferTime</code> property to 0.</p>
   * <p>Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears the buffer when <code>NetStream.pause()</code> is called. Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a delay.</p>
   * <p>For a single pause, the <code>NetStream.bufferLength</code> property has a limit of either 60 seconds or twice the value of <code>NetStream.bufferTime</code>, whichever value is higher. For example, if <code>bufferTime</code> is 20 seconds, Flash Player buffers until <code>NetStream.bufferLength</code> is the higher value of either 20*2 (40), or 60. In this case it buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is 60. If <code>bufferTime</code> is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is the higher value of 40*2 (80), or 60. In this case it buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is 80 seconds.</p>
   * <p>The <code>bufferLength</code> property also has an absolute limit. If any call to <code>pause()</code> causes <code>bufferLength</code> to increase more than 600 seconds or the value of <code>bufferTime</code> * 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player flushes the buffer and resets <code>bufferLength</code> to 0. For example, if <code>bufferTime</code> is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if <code>bufferLength</code> reaches 600 seconds; if <code>bufferTime</code> is 360 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if <code>bufferLength</code> reaches 720 seconds.</p>
   * <p><b>Tip</b>: You can use <code>NetStream.pause()</code> in code to buffer data while viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when the main video starts.</p>
   * <p>For more information about the new pause behavior, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en">http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en</a>.</p>
   * <p><b>Flash Media Server</b>. The buffer behavior depends on whether the buffer time is set on a publishing stream or a subscribing stream. For a publishing stream, <code>bufferTime</code> specifies how long the outgoing buffer can grow before the application starts dropping frames. On a high-speed connection, buffer time is not a concern; data is sent almost as quickly as the application can buffer it. On a slow connection, however, there can be a significant difference between how fast the application buffers the data and how fast it is sent to the client.</p>
   * <p>For a subscribing stream, <code>bufferTime</code> specifies how long to buffer incoming data before starting to display the stream.</p>
   * <p>When a recorded stream is played, if <code>bufferTime</code> is 0, Flash sets it to a small value (approximately 10 milliseconds). If live streams are later played (for example, from a playlist), this buffer time persists. That is, <code>bufferTime</code> remains nonzero for the stream.</p>

Use this property for progressive video download, and to load files that are outside the calling SWF file's own domain. This property is ignored when you are using RTMP.
   * <p>Set this property to <code>true</code> to call <code>BitmapData.draw()</code> on a video file loaded from a domain outside that of the calling SWF. The <code>BitmapData.draw()</code> method provides pixel-level access to the video. If you call <code>BitmapData.draw()</code> without setting the <code>checkPolicyFile</code> property to <code>true</code> at loading time, you can get a <code>SecurityError</code> exception because the required policy file was not downloaded.</p>
   * <p>Do not set this property to true unless you want pixel-level access to the video you are loading. Checking for a policy file consumes network bandwidth and can delay the start of your download.</p>
   * <p>When you call the <code>NetStream.play()</code> method with <code>checkPolicyFile</code> set to <code>true</code>, Flash Player or the AIR runtime must either successfully download a relevant cross-domain policy file or determine that no such policy file exists before it begins downloading. To verify the existence of a policy file, Flash Player or the AIR runtime performs the following actions, in this order:</p><ol>
   * <li>The application considers policy files that have already been downloaded.</li>
   * <li>The application tries to download any pending policy files specified in calls to the <code>Security.loadPolicyFile()</code> method.</li>
   * <li>The application tries to download a policy file from the default location that corresponds to the URL you passed to <code>NetStream.play()</code>, which is <code>/crossdomain.xml</code> on the same server as that URL.</li></ol>
   * <p>In all cases, Flash Player or Adobe AIR requires that an appropriate policy file exist on the video's server, that it provide access to the object at the URL you passed to <code>play()</code> based on the policy file's location, and that it allow the domain of the calling code's file to access the video, through one or more <code><allow-access-from></code> tags.</p>
   * <p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code>, the application waits until the policy file is verified before downloading the video. Wait to perform any pixel-level operations on the video data, such as calling <code>BitmapData.draw()</code>, until you receive <code>onMetaData</code> or <code>NetStatus</code> events from your NetStream object.</p>
   * <p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code> but no relevant policy file is found, you won't receive an error until you perform an operation that requires a policy file, and then the application throws a SecurityError exception.</p>
   * <p>Be careful with <code>checkPolicyFile</code> if you are downloading a file from a URL that uses server-side HTTP redirects. The application tries to retrieve policy files that correspond to the initial URL that you specify in <code>NetStream.play()</code>. If the final file comes from a different URL because of HTTP redirects, the initially downloaded policy files might not be applicable to the file's final URL, which is the URL that matters in security decisions.</p>

When you specify <code>snapshotMilliseconds</code>, you control how much time elapses between recorded frames. When you specify <code>fps</code> using <code>Camera.setMode()</code>, you are controlling how much time elapses during recording and playback.</p>
   * <p>For example, suppose you want to take a snapshot every 5 minutes for a total of 100 snapshots. You can do this in two ways:</p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>You can issue a <code>NetStream.attachCamera(myCamera, 500)</code> command 100 times, once every 5 minutes. This takes 500 minutes to record, but the resulting file will play back in 50 seconds (100 frames with 500 milliseconds between frames).</li>
   * <li>You can issue a <code>Camera.setMode()</code> command with an <code>fps</code> value of 1/300 (one per 300 seconds, or one every 5 minutes), and then issue a <code>NetStream.attachCamera(source)</code> command, letting the camera capture continuously for 500 minutes. The resulting file will play back in 500 minutes — the same length of time that it took to record — with each frame being displayed for 5 minutes.</li></ul>
   * <p>Both techniques capture the same 500 frames, and both approaches are useful; the approach to use depends primarily on your playback requirements. For example, in the second case, you could be recording audio the entire time. Also, both files would be approximately the same size.</p>
   * @param theCamera The source of the video transmission. Valid values are a Camera object (which starts capturing video) and <code>null</code>. If you pass <code>null</code>, the application stops capturing video, and any additional parameters you send are ignored.
   * @param snapshotMilliseconds Specifies whether the video stream is continuous, a single frame, or a series of single frames used to create time-lapse photography.
   * <ul>
   * <li>If you omit this parameter, the application captures all video until you pass a value of <code>null</code> to <code>attachCamera</code>.</li>
   * <li>If you pass 0, the application captures only a single video frame. Use this value to transmit "snapshots" within a preexisting stream. Flash Player or AIR interprets invalid, negative, or nonnumeric arguments as 0.</li>
   * <li>If you pass a positive number, the application captures a single video frame and then appends a pause of the specified length as a trailer on the snapshot. Use this value to create time-lapse photography effects.</li></ul>

   * Pauses playback of a video stream. Calling this method does nothing if the video is already paused. To resume play after pausing a video, call <code>resume()</code>. To toggle between pause and play (first pausing the video, then resuming), call <code>togglePause()</code>.
   * <p>Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears the buffer when <code>NetStream.pause()</code> is called. This behavior is called "smart pause". Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a delay.</p>
   * <p><b>Note:</b> For backwards compatibility, the <code>"NetStream.Buffer.Flush"</code> event (see the <code>NetStatusEvent.info</code> property) still fires, although the server does not flush the buffer.</p>
   * <p>For a single pause, the <code>NetStream.bufferLength</code> property has a limit of either 60 seconds or twice the value of <code>NetStream.bufferTime</code>, whichever value is higher. For example, if <code>bufferTime</code> is 20 seconds, Flash Player buffers until <code>NetStream.bufferLength</code> is the higher value of either 20*2 (40), or 60, so in this case it buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is 60. If <code>bufferTime</code> is 40 seconds, Flash Player buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is the higher value of 40*2 (80), or 60, so in this case it buffers until <code>bufferLength</code> is 80 seconds.</p>
   * <p>The <code>bufferLength</code> property also has an absolute limit. If any call to <code>pause()</code> causes <code>bufferLength</code> to increase more than 600 seconds or the value of <code>bufferTime</code> * 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player flushes the buffer and resets <code>bufferLength</code> to 0. For example, if <code>bufferTime</code> is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if <code>bufferLength</code> reaches 600 seconds; if <code>bufferTime</code> is 360 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if <code>bufferLength</code> reaches 720 seconds.</p>
   * <p><b>Tip</b>: You can use <code>NetStream.pause()</code> in code to buffer data while viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when the main video starts.</p>

Use Data Generation Mode to stream content over HTTP from the Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming Origin Module on an Apache HTTP Server. HTTP Dynamic Streaming lets clients seek quickly to any point in a file. The Open Source Media Framework (OSMF) supports HTTP Dynamic Streaming for vod and live streams.

   * <p>When you use this method without Flash Media Server, there are security considerations. A file in the local-trusted or local-with-networking sandbox can load and play a video file from the remote sandbox, but cannot access the remote file's data without explicit permission in the form of a URL policy file. Also, you can prevent a SWF file running in Flash Player from using this method by setting the <code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF content.

 * <li>Call <code>NetConnection.addEventListener()</code> to listen for NetStatusEvent events.</li>
 * <li>On the <code>"NetConnection.Connect.Success"</code> event, create a NetStream object and pass the NetConnection object to the constructor.</li>
 * <li>To capture audio and video, call the <code>NetStream.attachAudio()</code>method and the <code>NetStream.attachCamera()</code> method.</li>
 * <li>To publish a stream, call the <code>NetStream.publish()</code> method. You can record the data as you publish it so that users can play it back later.</li></ol>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> A NetStream can either publish a stream or play a stream, it cannot do both. To publish a stream and view the playback from the server, create two NetStream objects. You can send multiple NetStream objects over one NetConnection object.</p>
 * <p>When Flash Media Server records a stream it creates a file. By default, the server creates a directory with the application instance name passed to <code>NetConnection.connect()</code> and stores the file in the directory. For example, the following code connects to the default instance of the "lectureseries" application and records a stream called "lecture". The file "lecture.flv" is recorded in the applications/lectureseries/streams/_definst_ directory:</p>
 * <listing>
 *      var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection();

/**
 * Seeks the keyframe (also called an I-frame in the video industry) closest to the specified location. The keyframe is placed at an offset, in seconds, from the beginning of the stream.
 * <p>Video streams are usually encoded with two types of frames, keyframes (or I-frames) and P-frames. A keyframe contains an entire image, while a P-frame is an interim frame that provides additional video information between keyframes. A video stream typically has a keyframe every 10-50 frames.</p>
 * <p>Flash Media Server has several types of seek behavior: enhanced seeking and smart seeking.</p>
 * <p>Enhanced seeking</p>
 * <p>Enhanced seeking is enabled by default. To disable enhanced seeking, on Flash Media Server set the <code>EnhancedSeek</code> element in the <code>Application.xml</code> configuration file to <code>false</code>.</p>
 * <p>If enhanced seeking is enabled, the server generates a new keyframe at <code>offset</code> based on the previous keyframe and any intervening P-frames. However, generating keyframes creates a high processing load on the server and distortion might occur in the generated keyframe. If the video codec is On2, the keyframe before the seek point and any P-frames between the keyframe and the seek point are sent to the client.</p>
 * <p>If enhanced seeking is disabled, the server starts streaming from the nearest keyframe. For example, suppose a video has keyframes at 0 seconds and 10 seconds. A seek to 4 seconds causes playback to start at 4 seconds using the keyframe at 0 seconds. The video stays frozen until it reaches the next keyframe at 10 seconds. To get a better seeking experience, you need to reduce the keyframe interval. In normal seek mode, you cannot start the video at a point between the keyframes.</p>
 * <p>Smart seeking</p>
 * <p>To enable smart seeking, set <code>NetStream.inBufferSeek</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>
 * <p>Smart seeking allows Flash Player to seek within an existing back buffer and forward buffer. When smart seeking is disabled, each time <code>seek()</code> is called Flash Player flushes the buffer and requests data from the server. For more information, see <code>NetStream.inBufferSeek</code>.</p>
 * <p>Seeking in Data Generation Mode</p>
 * <p>When you call <code>seek()</code> on a NetStream in Data Generation Mode, all bytes passed to <code>appendBytes()</code> are discarded (not placed in the buffer, accumulated in the partial message FIFO, or parsed for seek points) until you call <code>appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_BEGIN)</code> or <code>appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_SEEK)</code> to reset the parser. For information about Data Generation Mode, see <code>NetStream.play()</code>.</p>
 * @param offset The approximate time value, in seconds, to move to in a video file. With Flash Media Server, if <code><EnhancedSeek></code> is set to <code>true</code> in the Application.xml configuration file (which it is by default), the server generates a keyframe at <code>offset</code>.
 * <ul>
 * <li>To return to the beginning of the stream, pass 0 for <code>offset</code>.</li>
 * <li>To seek forward from the beginning of the stream, pass the number of seconds to advance. For example, to position the playhead at 15 seconds from the beginning (or the keyframe before 15 seconds), use <code>myStream.seek(15)</code>.</li>
 * <li>To seek relative to the current position, pass <code>NetStream.time + n</code> or <code>NetStream.time - n</code> to seek <code>n</code> seconds forward or backward, respectively, from the current position. For example, to rewind 20 seconds from the current position, use <code>NetStream.seek(NetStream.time - 20).</code></li></ul>

/**
 * Sends a message on a published stream to all subscribing clients. This method is available only to the publisher of the specified stream. This method is available for use with Flash Media Server only. To process and respond to this message, create a handler on the <code>NetStream</code> object, for example, <code>ns.HandlerName</code>.
 * <p>Flash Player or AIR does not serialize methods or their data, object prototype variables, or non-enumerable variables. For display objects, Flash Player or AIR serializes the path but none of the data.</p>
 * <p>You can call the <code>send()</code> method to add data keyframes to a live stream published to Flash Media Server. A data keyframe is a message a publisher adds to a live stream. Data keyframes are typically used to add metadata to a live stream before data is captured for the stream from camera and microphone. A publisher can add a data keyframe at any time while the live stream is being published. The data keyframe is saved in the server's memory as long as the publisher is connected to the server.</p>
 * <p>Clients who are subscribed to the live stream before a data keyframe is added receive the keyframe as soon as it is added. Clients who subscribe to the live stream after the data keyframe is added receive the keyframe when they subscribe.</p>
 * <p>To add a keyframe of metadata to a live stream sent to Flash Media Server, use <code>&#64;setDataFrame</code> as the handler name, followed by two additional arguments, for example:</p>
 * <listing>
 *      var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc);
 *      ns.send("&#64;setDataFrame", "onMetaData", metaData);
 *     </listing>
 * <p>The <code>&#64;setDataFrame</code> argument refers to a special handler built in to Flash Media Server. The <code>onMetaData</code> argument is the name of a callback function in your client application that listens for the <code>onMetaData</code> event and retrieves the metadata. The third item, <code>metaData</code>, is an instance of <code>Object</code> or <code>Array</code> with properties that define the metadata values.</p>
 * <p>Use <code>&#64;clearDataFrame</code> to clear a keyframe of metadata that has already been set in the stream:</p>
 * <listing>
 *      ns.send("@clearDataFrame", "onMetaData");
 *     </listing>
 * @param handlerName The message to send; also the name of the ActionScript handler to receive the message. The handler name can be only one level deep (that is, it can't be of the form parent/child) and is relative to the stream object. Do not use a reserved term for a handler name. For example, using "<code>close</code>" as a handler name causes the method to fail. With Flash Media Server, use <code>&#64;setDataFrame</code> to add a keyframe of metadata to a live stream or <code>&#64;clearDataFrame</code> to remove a keyframe.
 * @param rest Optional arguments that can be of any type. They are serialized and sent over the connection, and the receiving handler receives them in the same order. If a parameter is a circular object (for example, a linked list that is circular), the serializer handles the references correctly. With Flash Media Server, if <code>&#64;setDataFrame</code> is the first argument, use <code>onMetaData</code> as the second argument; for the third argument, pass an instance of <code>Object</code> or <code>Array</code> that has the metadata set as properties. See the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_devguide_en">Flash Media Server Developer Guide</a> for a list of suggested property names. With <code>&#64;clearDataFrame</code> as the first argument, use <code>onMetaData</code> as the second argument and no third argument.

 * <div>To respond to a data keyframe added to a video, the client needs to define an <code>onMetaData</code> event handler.

 * Establishes a listener to respond when an embedded cue point is reached while playing a video file. You can use the listener to trigger actions in your code when the video reaches a specific cue point, which lets you synchronize other actions in your application with video playback events. For information about video file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en</a>.
 * <p><code>onCuePoint</code> is actually a property of the <code>NetStream.client</code> object. IThe property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the <code>addEventListener()</code> method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process <code>onCuePoint</code> as an event. Define a callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The object that the <code>client</code> property of a NetStream instance references.</li>
 * <li>An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.</li></ul>
 * <p>The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the <code>NetStream.play()</code> method, but before the video playhead has advanced.</p>
 * <p>You can embed the following types of cue points in a video file:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A navigation cue point specifies a keyframe within the video file and the cue point's <code>time</code> property corresponds to that exact keyframe. Navigation cue points are often used as bookmarks or entry points to let users navigate through the video file.</li>
 * <li>An event cue point specifies a time. The time may or may not correspond to a specific keyframe. An event cue point usually represents a time in the video when something happens that could be used to trigger other application events.</li></ul>
 * <p>The <code>onCuePoint</code> event object has the following properties:</p>
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>name</code></td>
 * <td>The name given to the cue point when it was embedded in the video file.</td></tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>parameters</code></td>
 * <td>An associative array of name and value pair strings specified for this cue point. Any valid string can be used for the parameter name or value.</td></tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>time</code></td>
 * <td>The time in seconds at which the cue point occurred in the video file during playback.</td></tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>type</code></td>
 * <td>The type of cue point that was reached, either navigation or event.</td></tr></table>
 * <p>You can define cue points in a video file when you first encode the file, or when you import a video clip in the Flash authoring tool by using the Video Import wizard.</p>
 * <p>The <code>onMetaData</code> event also retrieves information about the cue points in a video file. However the <code>onMetaData</code> event gets information about all of the cue points before the video begins playing. The <code>onCuePoint</code> event receives information about a single cue point at the time specified for that cue point during playback.</p>
 * <p>Generally, to have your code respond to a specific cue point at the time it occurs, use the <code>onCuePoint</code> event to trigger some action in your code.</p>
 * <p>You can use the list of cue points provided to the <code>onMetaData</code> event to let the user start playing the video at predefined points along the video stream. Pass the value of the cue point's <code>time</code> property to the <code>NetStream.seek()</code> method to play the video from that cue point.</p>

/**
 * Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives descriptive information embedded in the video being played. For information about video file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en</a>.
 * <p><code>onMetaData</code> is actually a property of the <code>NetStream.client</code> object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description and the <code>NetStream.client</code> property. You cannot use the <code>addEventListener()</code> method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for or process <code>onMetaData</code> as an event. Define a single callback function and attach it to one of the following objects:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The object that the <code>client</code> property of a NetStream instance references.</li>
 * <li>An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream is a sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at runtime. You can create a subclass of NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic and add the event handler function to an instance of the subclass.</li></ul>
 * <p>The Flash Video Exporter utility (version 1.1 or later) embeds a video's duration, creation date, data rates, and other information into the video file itself. Different video encoders embed different sets of meta data.</p>
 * <p>The associated event listener is triggered after a call to the <code>NetStream.play()</code> method, but before the video playhead has advanced.</p>
 * <p>In many cases, the duration value embedded in stream metadata approximates the actual duration but is not exact. In other words, it does not always match the value of the <code>NetStream.time</code> property when the playhead is at the end of the video stream.</p>
 * <p>The event object passed to the onMetaData event handler contains one property for each piece of data.</p>
 * @example The following example shows how you can load external FLV files and respond to metadata and cue points.

/**
 * Establishes a listener to respond when a NetStream object has completely played a stream. The associated event object provides information in addition to what's returned by the <code>netStatus</code> event. You can use this property to trigger actions in your code when a NetStream object has switched from one stream to another stream in a playlist (as indicated by the information object <code>NetStream.Play.Switch</code>) or when a NetStream object has played to the end (as indicated by the information object <code>NetStream.Play.Complete</code>).
 * <p><code>onPlayStaus</code> is actually a property of the <code>NetStream.client</code> object.

For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the <code>addEventListener()</code> method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process <code>onPlayStatus</code> as an event.

/**
 * Establishes a listener to respond when Flash Player receives text data embedded in a media file that is playing. The text data is in UTF-8 format and can contain information about formatting based on the 3GP timed text specification.
 * <p><code>onTextData</code> is actually a property of the <code>NetStream.client</code> object. The property is listed in the Events section because it responds to a data event, either when streaming media using Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback. For more information, see the NetStream class description. You cannot use the <code>addEventListener()</code> method, or any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process <code>onTextData</code> as an event.

 * <p>The onTextData event object contains one property for each piece of text data.</p>
 * @example The code in this example uses the <code>Netstream.client</code> property to handle the callback functions for <code>onTextData</code> and <code>onImageData</code>. The <code>onImageDataHandler()</code> function uses the onImageData event object <code>imageData</code> to store the byte array. And, the <code>onTextDataHandler()</code> function uses the onTextData event object <code>textData</code> to store the pieces of text data (each piece of data is a property of the <code>textData</code> object).
 * <p>You need to substitute a real location to a media file with text or image metadata for the location <code>"yourURL"</code> in the code.</p>
 * <p>You can also handle image and text data using a custom class. See the article <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/quickstart">Handling metadata and cue points in Flash video</a> for more information and examples.</p>
