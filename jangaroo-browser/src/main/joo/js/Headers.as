/**
 * The Headers interface of the Fetch API allows you to perform various actions on HTTP request and response headers.
 * These actions include retrieving, setting, adding to, and removing headers from the list of the request's headers. A
 * Headers object has an associated header list, which is initially empty and consists of zero or more name and value pairs.
 * You can add to this using methods like append() (see Examples.) In all methods of this interface, header names are
 * matched by case-insensitive byte sequence.
 *
 * For security reasons, some headers can only be controlled by the user agent. These headers include the forbidden
 * header names  and forbidden response header names.
 *
 * A Headers object also has an associated guard, which takes a value of immutable, request, request-no-cors, response,
 * or none. This affects whether the set(), delete(), and append() methods will mutate the header. For more information
 * see Guard.
 *
 * You can retrieve a Headers object via the Request.headers and Response.headers properties, and create a new Headers
 * object using the Headers.Headers() constructor.
 *
 * An object implementing Headers can directly be used in a for...of structure, instead of entries(): for (var p of
 * myHeaders) is equivalent to for (var p of myHeaders.entries()).
