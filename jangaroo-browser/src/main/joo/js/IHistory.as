   *
   * @param state The state object is a JavaScript object which is associated with the new history entry created by
   *              <code>#pushState</code>. Whenever the user navigates to the new state, a popstate event is fired, and
   *              the state property of the event contains a copy of the history entry's state object.
   *              The state object can be anything that can be serialized. Because Firefox saves state objects to the
   *              user's disk so they can be restored after the user restarts the browser, we impose a size limit of
   *              640k characters on the serialized representation of a state object. If you pass a state object whose
   *              serialized representation is larger than this to <code>#pushState</code>, the method will throw an
   *              exception. If you need more space than this, you're encouraged to use sessionStorage and/or
   *              localStorage.
   * @param title Most browsers currently ignore this parameter, although they may use it in the future. Passing the
   *              empty string here should be safe against future changes to the method. Alternatively, you could pass a
   *              short title for the state to which you're moving.
   * @param url The new history entry's URL is given by this parameter. Note that the browser won't attempt to load this
   *            URL after a call to <code>#pushState</code>, but it might attempt to load the URL later, for instance
   *            after the user restarts the browser. The new URL does not need to be absolute; if it's relative, it's
   *            resolved relative to the current URL. The new URL must be of the same origin as the current URL;
   *            otherwise, <code>#pushState</code> will throw an exception. If this parameter isn't specified, it's set
   *            to the document's current URL.
