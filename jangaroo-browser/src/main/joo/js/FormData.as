 * The FormData interface provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their
 * values, which can then be easily sent using the XMLHttpRequest.send() method. It uses the same format a form would
 * use if the encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".
 *
 * You can also pass it directly to the URLSearchParams constructor if you want to generate query parameters in the way
 * a &lt;form> would do if it were using simple GET submission.
 *
 * An object implementing FormData can directly be used in a for...of structure, instead of entries(): for (var p of
 * myFormData) is equivalent to for (var p of myFormData.entries()).
